## Write-up
	Cambridge Art Navigator is a personal iOS project that I worked on in the summer of 2017. It has been a really fun project to work on, and while it is fully functional right now, I think it could use a some UI improvements before being released to the app store The application basically shows an interactive map and a list of all the art installations in the city of Cambridge, MA, which is where I lived over the summer. If you are reading this, please give the app a try and let me know what you think :*
