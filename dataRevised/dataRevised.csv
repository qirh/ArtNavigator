Although he is one of the few artists still practicing the art of fresco painting, he now concentrates on the ""more portable"" medium of oil painting.

Rose-colored panes are punctuated by clear panels, and as one moves in and out of the structure, our view of our surroundings, through carefully callibrated spaces, makes subtle shifts. The wood bench extends beyond the perimeter of the shelter, evoking the length of a baseball dugout and the activity of waiting, shared by baseball player and bus rider alike.

In ""Quiet Cornerstone"", he has utilized stonecutting, an ancient tradition, whereas the right angled cornice and lettering speak more to Western European tradition. He believes that the passion an artist has for his material is translated in his work.

Using the unexpected but durable and affordable medium of yellow, black, red, and white construction pavers, she designed patterns around the square's five tree pits. The arrangements are derived from traditional quilt patterns, summoning up associations of comfort and warmth, as well as paying tribute to one of America's most enduring homespun artforms.Educated at Smith College and the University of Wisconsin, where she received her M.F.A., Goldman is a prolific and versatile artist.

At the south entrance, a praying mantis and a cricket, cast in a full three-dimensional sculpture, join their fellow insects in the salutation. Bronze reliefs are also found on the steel fence running along Commercial Avenue and embedded in granite elements throughout the park. Facing the outside are depictions of the weeds that ""grow in the urban wasteland,"" as Webb puts it, while the reliefs on the interior portray the flowers planted around them, along with a whole inventory of bugs and butterflies that thrive in the park, including Clover with Ant and Bee; Dandelions with Fritillary Butterfly and Prionus Beetle; Coreopsis; Coralbells; Daylily; Yarrow and Leafhopper. A bronze plaque, also made by the artist, lists all the bronze plants and creatures found in the park."
