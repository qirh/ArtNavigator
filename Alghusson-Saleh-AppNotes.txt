Write-up:
	I was thinking of an idea for an application to work on. And while browsing the city of Cambridge's API I noticed a data set for the public art installations in the city. And the idea of making an app to serve as a guide for the city's local art absolutely grabbed me. So, I started searching if any other devs have already did something similar and couldn't find any similar thing done for the city of Cambridge, but I found a lot for other cities.
	So, armed with the inspiration I got from all the other apps I looked at, I decided to go through with the idea and start developing the app. I anticipated that around the halfway mark of the deadline, I would be done with the beta version and from there I can dedicate more of my time and effort to beautify it. However, what I had not expected was the data set would be incomplete and have a lot of inconsistencies. All in all, I would say the data validation (or revalidation) took maybe 30%-50% of the time that it took to develop the app.
	Moreover, I really enjoyed the programming aspects of this app. The MVC model seemed intuitive to work with, especially after utilizing it for the last assignment I worked on. However, I really really struggled with the design aspects of this app. I had a lot of problems working with storyboard, actually, the day of the deadline I had to completely redesign more than half the application view controllers. Because I was trying to design the app from the beginning with all the objects have relative constrains and relative size. Since I thought that designing with everything relative would make it work on many more platforms. However, things kept breaking until I decided to develop it with some fixed sizes and fixed constraints to the superview.
	Nevertheless, the biggest problems I faced were not related to xCode or swift or any programming or design paradigms. But was around my inability to draw a concept of portraying the information thatI wanted to portray to the user. I even asked my little siblings for help in that regard haha. Over many trails, my ideas of design always revolved around sticking everything in a label and having labels stack over each other. Ultimately however, I worked on this submission version of the app, which I think portrays the information that I want it to do. But, it does not do so beautifully. So over the next few versions of the app, I would like to work on the aesthetics of it.
