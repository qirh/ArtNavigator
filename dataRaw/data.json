Katayama worked with landscape architect Cynthia Smith, members of the Porter Square Citizen Advisory Committee, and city staff to develop a bold design for the plaza. The goals of his design were to create a visual identity for the Square, integrate both sides of Massachusetts Avenue, unify the three parts of the plaza visually, and reduce the visual clutter of the busy intersection through simplification and clarity. Natural materials include stonewalls, Cape Ann granite boulders, and new trees and shrubs. Concrete pavers in light and dark grey create a pattern that addresses the entire width of the plaza in one visual sweep. A low steel wall and two free-standing panels continue this pattern with black and white graphics.\n\nToshihiro Katayama is Professor emeritus at Harvard University, where he taught for 30 years and served as the Director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. His work has been exhibited in more than 30 one-man exhibitions and he has created large-scale sculptures, murals, and environmental work in architectural spaces in the United States and Japan, including major work for the Ohara Art Museum in Kurashiki and the Panasonic Headquarters in Tokyo.

He began his exploration of African culture with a study of African religions, and that brought him, quite naturally, to a study of traditional art forms, the embodiment of belief and myth. Art, for Maduna, is spiritually nourishing. \"People gather strength through their roots,\" he says, \"and it is through art that we hear our ancestral voices.\" As an adult, Maduna returned to the neighborhoods of his childhood with reminders of the African heritage that many in the community share. \"Totem\" literally means the emblem of a clan or family.\n\nMaduna studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and has been an artist-in-residence in the African-American Masters program at Northeastern University.

It also celebrates the international character of the school. At the time of Conley's commission, Longfellow School's student body represented 43 different countries. Made with the Renaissance-era technique of fresco painting, this map, says Conley, \"is intended to remind us of the changing world we all belong to.\"\nConley first encountered map rooms in the early 1980s, when he traveled to Italy on a Fulbright scholarship. Although he is one of the few artists still practicing the art of fresco painting, he now concentrates on the \"more portable\" medium of oil painting. Conley has exhibited in solo and group shows around the country and his work is in several museums and corporate collections. Educated at the Pratt Institute, the Boston Museum School, and Tufts University, he serves as an adjunct professor in Fine Arts at Boston College and is curator for Boston College's McMullen Museum of Art." ]

The wood bench extends beyond the perimeter of the shelter, evoking the length of a baseball dugout and the activity of waiting, shared by baseball player and bus rider alike.

She chose the structure's maple wood for its warm golden tones. The glass tiles reflect and \"move\" light, while the etched \"squiggle\" designs on their surface suggest \"narrative, pathways, and the human body.\" The rainbow spectrum is actually acrylic paint on MDO board behind the glass.

Another metal element suggests the body of a bus, reminding viewers of Rosa Parks' refusal to sit at the back of a public bus in Alabama. Its yellow-orange colors also refer to schoolbuses, which have literally been the vehicles of desegregation for American public schools. Finally, Maduna's main choice of material for the biographical events - black perforated sheet metal - lends the figures a shadowy quality that softens the violence of the scenes yet doesn't diminish the work's powerful message of faith, love, and resistance.\n\nSculptor/painter Maduna is a lifelong resident of the Boston area. His site-specific work, which combines an interest in African art with his own expressive style, has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. Many of his public installations are located in the Cambridge and Boston area, including The Judge, a recent commission for the Roxbury District Court House.

The stone is presented as though it were an offering. Natural elements, such as stone and trees, are often a motif in Phillps' work. \"In the woods, looking for sticks and stones for my sculpture,\" he says, \"I am often impressed by the persistence of life. A root can slowly establish a foothold and split a large rock. Lichen and moss extract their nourishment directly from the stone, ultimately processing granite into soil.\" Of casting bronze tree limbs, Phillips adds, \"Metal branches are remarkable in that, although they are perceived as real, they can do things structurally that real twigs can't.

A prime example of art-furniture, the desk helps shape the character of the library, while serving both decorative and functional purposes.\n\nRyerson says that furniture appeals to him because the viewer can interact with it. His work invites a connection that is often hard to obtain with other fine arts, such as sculpture. He feels the intimacy and casualness of his work make it less intimidating to people. \"I want people to be able to approach my work,\" he says. \"My artwork isn't about heavy existential crises - it's about feeling good, about experiencing pleasure.\"\n\nRyerson has operated Ryerson Studios located in Cambridge for many years, making custom furniture sold through galleries and on a commission basis. Originally a boat builder in Maine, he shifted into furniture because, as he says, it gave him a \"freedom of expression.\" In 1998 he received the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts artist award. The society is the oldest nonprofit craft organization in America and awarded Ryerson the prize for \"showing mastery in his medium by creating original and creative contemporary crafts.\"\n\n" ]

The art includes a half-mile long glassphalt path that traverses the central mound in the park, providing access to the top and views of the Boston skyline. With 22 tons of crushed glass and mirror mixed into the asphalt, the use of glassphalt (for the first time in Massachusetts) suggests that there exist creative, sound solutions to environmental problems. The artist and the landscape architect also collaborated on a planting plan for the mound. The final phase of the art project will include sculptural disks made of rubber and will involve members of all the different cultures of the City in a creative interaction.\n\nMierle Laderman Ukeles is best known for public art dealing with waste and urban maintenance issues, including on-site installations and performances in New York City sanitation facilities.
