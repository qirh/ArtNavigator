The underground pipes that bring the water throughout the city are marked on the map, along with water fountains, swimming pools, and ponds. Actual water pipes form functional seats and suggest the sizes of pipes in the map. A transparent water column is placed on the map at the site of the city's holding reservoir, Payson Park. The art continues outside the building. A shallow depression on both sides of a path reveals a 42 inch pipe, reminding us of the connection between the treatment facility and Fresh Pond, the city's reservoir. A circular opening in the fence around the pond focuses views of the water intake. A drinking fountain in the form of a squirting arc offers water to users of the path. When they drink from the fountain, the water column reacts with light, bubbles and changes in the water level, as if the water had been drawn through the large pipe back from the treatment facility. There are also thirteen bronze utility covers located throughout the city, each with a different water-related image. The locations of the covers are marked on the floor map to encourage a treasure hunt in the neighborhoods.

Andrews has proposed to create aluminum security screens for the window openings, with colored glass and optical lenses inserted into the screen. The glass will cast colored shadows and the lenses will reflect images of passers-by on the interior walls. The proposal works on two levels: On a practical level, the grid structure makes the large window openings safe and protects the stairway from wind and rain, without enclosing it with solid glass. And on an aesthetic level, this practical solution provides visual interest and improves the look of the building where it is most visible.</about_the_work></row><row _id="274" _uuid="DBC2D815-BB6B-4368-AC94-6DB7BE9F390F" _position="274" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/274"><accession_number>CAC04.02</accession_number><last_name>Uchida</last_name><first_name>Bart</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>"Rose Arbor"</title><year>2004</year><location_name_of_site>Squirrel Brand Park</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>The corner of Boardman and Broadway Streets</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Metal  </object_type><material>Steel</material><detail_material>Steel rod (painted)</detail_material><size>Arbor (overall size): H 10’2” x W 18’ x D 6’</size><about_the_work>Cambridge Arts Council commissioned Bart Uchida to create a work of public art for the Park that was renovated in 2004.

Wood sculptures mix geometrical forms (the five Platonic solids) with shapes found in the natural world. Evoking everything from galaxies and tornadoes to atoms and crystals, this piece inspires reverence and awe for both the variety and surprising similarities of forms found on Earth and in the cosmos.
Beatty is a graduate of the University of Kansas and the Massachusetts College of Art. His work has appeared in exhibitions throughout the Boston area and is in the collections of several museums and corporations, including the DeCordova Museum in Lincoln, Massachusetts. He participated in the DeCordova's popular 1995 "Strokes of Genius" installation, in which 18 artists each created a unique hole for a functioning mini golf course. He currently resides in Newton, Massachusetts, and teaches sculpture at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts.</about_the_work></row><row _id="8" _uuid="D73F4313-1A84-4798-A10F-AFCE725A1AF9" _position="8" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/8"><accession_number>CAC08.03a</accession_number><last_name>Bell</last_name><first_name>Roberley</first_name><artist_gender>Female</artist_gender><title>"Here and There" (upright gourd)</title><year>2008</year><location_name_of_site>Costa Lopez Taylor Park and Community Garden</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>the corner of Lopez and Charles St.</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Metal-Painted Steel</object_type><material>Paint on steel</material><detail_material>Steel, painted (Tnemec) </detail_material><size>9' x 16' x 6'</size><additional_description>Steel rod "trellis" gourds (2) + gate</additional_description><about_the_work>Roberley Bell created a sculpture, consisting of an open trellis in the shape of two gourds with attached gates.

the "map room" found in many Renaissance-era Italian government buildings. In Conley's words, maps historically represented "influence, trade, knowledge, and power." This mural certainly encourages knowledge - it's located on the west wall of the school library and can be used as a teaching tool. It also celebrates the international character of the school. At the time of Conley's commission, Longfellow School's student body represented 43 different countries. Made with the Renaissance-era technique of fresco painting, this map, says Conley, "is intended to remind us of the changing world we all belong to."
Conley first encountered map rooms in the early 1980s, when he traveled to Italy on a Fulbright scholarship. Although he is one of the few artists still practicing the art of fresco painting, he now concentrates on the "more portable" medium of oil painting. Conley has exhibited in solo and group shows around the country and his work is in several museums and corporate collections. Educated at the Pratt Institute, the Boston Museum School, and Tufts University, he serves as an adjunct professor in Fine Arts at Boston College and is curator for Boston College's McMullen Museum of Art.</about_the_work></row><row _id="17" _uuid="CFD27719-5B32-4502-80B7-B6D12497492F" _position="17" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/17"><accession_number>CAC97.01a</accession_number><last_name>Coogan</last_name><first_name>Jay</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>"Stop-Action-Frieze" (blue figure wearing skirt holding hands)</title><year>1997</year><location_name_of_site>Frisoli Youth Center, interior</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>61 Willow St., Frisoli Youth Center, around the interior of the youth center's two-story lobby</location_description><interior_exterior>Interior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Metal-Painted Aluminum</object_type><material>Aluminum</material><detail_material>Aluminum, powder-coated</detail_material><size>22 figures each 3' high, with 5 additional separate ball shapes.</size><additional_description>Series of figures mounted on walls near ceiling around foyer</additional_description><about_the_work>Appropriately entitled "Stop-Action-Frieze," Jay Coogan's sculptural frieze consists of a series of three-foot tall aluminum figures 'frozen' in mid-action.

Her choice of materials and sculptural forms reference the past and present uses of the Park. The shelter sits on the edge of a small body of water ("Jerry's Pit") that once was a clay pit for the local nineteenth-century brickmaking industry. Later it became a swimming hole and eventually an industrial site and environmental blemish.

Davis's rose-tinted glass panels forming the walls of the bus shelter make a reference to our desire to see beauty where there is blight. Rose-colored panes are punctuated by clear panels, and as one moves in and out of the structure, our view of our surroundings, through carefully callibrated spaces, makes subtle shifts. The wood bench extends beyond the perimeter of the shelter, evoking the length of a baseball dugout and the activity of waiting, shared by baseball player and bus rider alike. The shelter has extra height and encourages an upward glance, where the rose of the glass, the blue of the sky, and the tips of the nearby trees share one's frame of vision.

The other side of the sculpture is rough-hewn stone, a showcase for the granite that Dorrien selected for its texture and shading. On this same side are three steps, also suggesting that the piece is a ruin, which the sculptor painstakingly cut into the stone, using a time-honored method.

Dorrien states that his "work is a marriage of many influences." In "Quiet Cornerstone", he has utilized stonecutting, an ancient tradition, whereas the right angled cornice and lettering speak more to Western European tradition. He believes that the passion an artist has for his material is translated in his work. "Even with a public piece one wants to make beautiful objects, to provoke questions, to make a personal statement; but finally public art is a gift to others, and if you love your medium, that magic comes through."

Dorrien was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He studied at the Montserrat School of Art and the Massachusetts College of Art, and has taught at Bentley College, and the New England School of Art and presently teaches at Wellesley College. He has several public art installations in Massachusetts, and has shown widely in the Boston area.

Eddy was awarded the commission to execute a large mural on the exposed west wall of the Inman Square Firehouse. The result is a three times life-size portrait of all members of Engine Company No. 5 in firefighting gear, along with the company dalmatian, posed around one of their pump trucks. Also included in the scene are two volunteer firemen straight out of history. Benjamin Franklin, who founded the first volunteer fire department in the country, stands on the running board in a pair of red sneakers. George Washington, who resided in Cambridge during the Siege of Boston, is holding a couple of pails. Eddy left the natural brick surrounding the mural exposed, in tribute to the handsome, Italian-style firehouse.

Park's 1955 refusal to sit in the back of an Alabama bus sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a landmark event of the Civil Rights Movement. Fichter shows Parks telling her story to a group of school-children, whose diverse ethnicities not only reflect Cambridge's multi-cultural makeup but also embody the spirit of the Civil Rights Movement. Park's struggle for equal rights everywhere is represented by two opposing images: the chains of oppression and interlinked hands demonstrating the power of unity and resistance.

As the sun moves through its daily and seasonal cycles, viewers can experience the piece in a variety of moods and configurations.</about_the_work></row><row _id="62" _uuid="39A862FE-0088-4D7D-95E0-832A935887D7" _position="62" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/62"><accession_number>CAC86.02</accession_number><last_name>Galvez</last_name><first_name>Daniel</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>"Crossroads"</title><year>1986</year><location_name_of_site>Pearl Street Parking Garage</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>32 Pearl St., Intersection of Pearl and Green Streets, facing Pearl street </location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Mural</category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Painting </object_type><material>Acrylic enamel on concrete </material><detail_material>Enamel on concrete</detail_material><size>28' x 46'</size><about_the_work>Muralist Daniel Galvez sought input from the community in the concept and design of this "Central Square family album." The 1,200-square-foot collage of people and architectural landmarks is composed in the shape of the universal symbol for infinity. This way Galvez connects leather-clad teens with an elderly couple; a waiter from an Indian restaurant with Greek Festival dancers. Also in the mix are local celebrities like R &amp; B singer Little Joe Cook and Jimmy the Shoemaker (shown in the upper detail). Alert viewers will catch Galvez's clever means of crediting himself and his volunteer assistants: on the front page of a Cambridge Chronicle painted in the bottom left of the mural.
Galvez, who makes his home in Oakland, California, studied painting at the California College of Arts and Crafts and San Francisco State University. His large-scale murals, inspired by traditional Mexican mural painting, grace exterior and interior spaces throughout the U.S. His best-known works include the 63-foot Homage to Malcolm X (1997) in New York City and Guardians of the Past, Stewards of the Future (1999), a pair of murals for the U.S. Department of the Interior in Washington, D.C.

He then had the iron galvanized to make the flowers fully immune to the forces of nature. "They provide pleasure throughout the four seasons and remind us that plant life will spring forth once again," says Gerakaris.

To create the sculptures the artist researched the heritage and flavor of East Cambridge flower and vegetable gardens. The sculptures are set amid the surrounding plant life and vegetation. One sculpture depicts Sunflowers intertwined with Grapevines sprouting from the base, which the artist sees as a floral fountain -- an explosion of the life force and energy of this community. The other work depicts the Poppy, Daylily and Lily-of-the-Valley.

Gerakaris specializes in site-specific sculptural and architectural metalwork utilizing primarily forged metals. He has completed public works for the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority, City of Boston, and other agencies. In Cambridge, Gerakaris has another botanical artwork at the Blacksmith House on Brattle Street in Harvard Square.</about_the_work></row><row _id="70" _uuid="16909D96-A44D-4E91-9B79-BEF130EA56D4" _position="70" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/70"><accession_number>CAC04.01e</accession_number><last_name>Glier</last_name><first_name>Michael</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>"Town Green" (2nd floor North wall)</title><year>2004</year><location_name_of_site>City Hall Annex</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>City Hall Annex on the corner of Broadway and Inman St, on large wall with windows on second floor in the building's atrium.</location_description><interior_exterior>Interior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Mural </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Paintings</object_type><material>Acrylic on sheetrock </material><size>12'1.5"H x 4'1"W (proper left panel), 12'1.5"H x 4'0.5"W (proper right panel [closer to conference room])</size><about_the_work>Glier is painting three large walls in the building's two-story atrium to transform the space into an indoor "garden."

Beginning with meetings of the Porter Square Citizen Advisory Committee in 1997, the city worked with the Porter Square Neighborhood Association, residents of Cambridge and Somerville, and the Porter Square businesses to develop a plan for the reconfiguration of Porter Square and its roadway design.

In accordance with the city's Public Art Ordinance, the Cambridge Arts Council commissioned artist Toshihiro Katayama to develop public art for the new plaza as the centerpiece of Porter Square. Katayama worked with landscape architect Cynthia Smith, members of the Porter Square Citizen Advisory Committee, and city staff to develop a bold design for the plaza. The goals of his design were to create a visual identity for the Square, integrate both sides of Massachusetts Avenue, unify the three parts of the plaza visually, and reduce the visual clutter of the busy intersection through simplification and clarity. Natural materials include stonewalls, Cape Ann granite boulders, and new trees and shrubs. Concrete pavers in light and dark grey create a pattern that addresses the entire width of the plaza in one visual sweep. A low steel wall and two free-standing panels continue this pattern with black and white graphics.

Toshihiro Katayama is Professor emeritus at Harvard University, where he taught for 30 years and served as the Director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. His work has been exhibited in more than 30 one-man exhibitions and he has created large-scale sculptures, murals, and environmental work in architectural spaces in the United States and Japan, including major work for the Ohara Art Museum in Kurashiki and the Panasonic Headquarters in Tokyo. In 1974, he collaborated with the poet Octavio Paz on a visual poetry book, Three Notations-Rotations, which was published jointly by Harvard University and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</about_the_work></row><row _id="126" _uuid="4C16C0EB-4693-4FC7-868F-C8C79F300687" _position="126" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/126"><accession_number>CAC06.01d</accession_number><last_name>Katayama</last_name><first_name>Toshihiro</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>"Porter Square Landscape Design" (boulders)</title><year>2006</year><location_name_of_site>Porter Square Plaza</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>At 1931 Mass Ave In front of the Porter Square Shopping Center shopping and directy across from the Porter Square T station</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Stone </object_type><material>Boulders </material><detail_material>Concrete, natural granite boulders, Tnemec painted steel, plantings</detail_material><size>W 258’ x D 94’ overall</size><additional_description>Full plaza design between Mass Ave. and shopping Ctr.</additional_description><about_the_work>The Porter Square Design Project improves the safety and function of Porter Square, with an emphasis on use by pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users.

Narrowing a wide intersection resulted in the creation of a small plaza with trees, which in turn became the canvas for well-known local painter, Jane Goldman.

Goldman's goal for her piece in newly constructed Sheridan Square was to create a serene "New England oasis in an urban environment." Using the unexpected but durable and affordable medium of yellow, black, red, and white construction pavers, she designed patterns around the square's five tree pits. The arrangements are derived from traditional quilt patterns, summoning up associations of comfort and warmth, as well as paying tribute to one of America's most enduring homespun artforms.

Educated at Smith College and the University of Wisconsin, where she received her M.F.A., Goldman is a prolific and versatile artist. Her works, executed in watercolor, oil, intaglio, lithography, relief, screenprint, and terrazzo, have been exhibited widely in the U.S. and Europe, and are part of the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum, Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Cleveland Museum, and Library of Congress, among others. Local travelers may be familiar with Goldman's aquatic-themed terrazzo walkways at Logan International Airport. She is a resident of Somerville, MA.

His East Cambridge-1852 is a narrative work celebrating the furniture-making and glass-blowing industries which flourished in East Cambridge during the 19th century. Located on 10 and 12-foot columns at the pedestrian entrance to the garage, the sculpture is constructed of mild steel that is forged and painted in high-gloss epoxy colors. From left to right, the work depicts: a brickworker's home with smoke from the hearthfire blowing out of the chimney; a glass-blower and his helper; the two main kiln buildings of the Boston Porcelain and Glassworks, with a worker in-between and black smoke wafting from the elevated industrial chimneys; the proud president of the company with a finished product in his hands; three workers' row houses; two chairs; three furniture makers; and Geldowsky's Furniture Company. A well-dressed Cambridge couple from that era and another worker's house complete the piece.

Born in Cleveland, Ohio, George received his BFA in Dimensional Design from the Philadelphia Museum College and an MFA in sculpture from the University of Kansas. He taught as a Professor at the Massachusetts College of Art and worked as chair of the sculpture department for many years. He has been awarded commissions in nearly all states through "one percent" programs.

The children's airplanes, motorcycles, ships, birds, sea creatures, rabbits, and dinosaurs combine with small squares of embedded shapes, numbers and letters. Also in the mix: ceramic "samplers" offering assorted bits of familiar childhood advice ("brush your teeth," "say thank you," "eat your spinach") and nonsense phrases ("liver and onions," cats and dogs," "honk if you love noise"). Background colors unify the diverse elements, while a band running along the bottom lists the student artists' first names.

The desk, built to triple scale, supports an equally oversized cup, bowl, and pile of books - all seemingly left behind by a giant schoolchild. Adding to the mystery are an open drawer and the pink glow from a hidden electric light. In designing this fairy-tale sculpture, Harries chose to work in wood, as opposed to cheaper materials like plastic, and had the piece crafted by a cabinetmaker using traditional techniques. Harries then covered the desk in six coats of different colored paint - providing an element of surprised delight when students scratch their initials into the "magic desk."
Harries's public art projects range from indoor installations like Gateway to large-scale outdoor structures that grace museums, parks, and institutions around the U.S. and Great Britain. Many of these works can be found in the Boston/Cambridge area, the most familiar being the Asaroton '76 cross walk at Haymarket and Glove Cycle at the Porter Square MBTA subway station. Harries has taught at the Boston's School of the Museum of Fine Arts and frequently gives lectures and workshops on public art around the country.</about_the_work></row><row _id="84" _uuid="F1AA3215-EBE6-434F-9563-18AC3C8531B8" _position="84" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/84"><accession_number>CAC02.01a</accession_number><last_name>Harries/Heder </last_name><first_name>Mags, Lajos</first_name><artist_gender>1 Female 1 Male </artist_gender><title>“Drawn Water” (drinking fountain)</title><year>2002</year><location_name_of_site>Water Purification Facility Walter Sullivan Water Facility</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>Behind the Fresh Pond Water Purification Facility </location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Bronze </object_type><material>Bronze </material><detail_material>Bronze (Exterior)</detail_material><size>43” high</size><additional_description>outdoor sculptural fountain along path</additional_description><about_the_work>Drawn Water combines real drinking water, symbolic elements, and a 2500 sq. foot map that focuses attention on the importance of water in our lives.

Her Five Little Monkeys was selected as Caldicott Medal Honor Book and the Society of Illustrators awarded her a citation of merit for Frogs Merry in 1962.
Juliet Kepes (1919-1979) resided in Cambridge for 53 years. She worked as a painter, sculptor, and graphic artist and collaborated with her husband, Gyorgy Kepes, on enamel murals for the Morse School and other public buildings.

provides a range of offerings for the entire North Cambridge community, but primarily serves children and teens ages eight to eighteen. When Hsu received this commission, she reflected that "kids like to hang out in hallways, stairwells, corners - places without a designated function." In response, she designed two seating alcoves where young people can "come and go; be part of traffic; observe and be observed." She wanted the design to be bright, welcoming, and clearly for kids. She chose the structure's maple wood for its warm golden tones. The glass tiles reflect and "move" light, while the etched "squiggle" designs on their surface suggest "narrative, pathways, and the human body." The rainbow spectrum is actually acrylic paint on MDO board behind the glass. Hsu dabbed on many layers of contrasting hues to achieve the rich, saturated colors.

An installation artist and sculptor, Hsu-Flanders studied at Wellesley College, Harvard University, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. She has exhibited extensively around the U.S. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University as well as in private collections. She is a resident of Cambridge, MA.

Her Five Little Monkeys was selected as Caldicott Medal Honor Book and the Society of Illustrators awarded her a citation of merit for Frogs Merry in 1962.
Juliet Kepes (1919-1979) resided in Cambridge for 53 years. She worked as a painter, sculptor, and graphic artist and collaborated with her husband, Gyorgy Kepes, on enamel murals for the Morse School and other public buildings.

Just as the song celebrates "the love between my sisters and my brothers, all over this land" the artwork presents scenes of cross-cultural understanding. Children and adults from different backgrounds fly kites, make music, shoot basketball, admire butterflies and birds, climb and play on the structure, and share stories. Inglese's signature style borrows from the tradition of stained glass: irregular clay shapes form images, which, in turn, are outlined by grout, much like the way lead surrounds stained glass.
A Massachusetts resident, Inglese studied at Sarah Lawrence College, at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome, and at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. She has received several grants for community based art workshops in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. Her other public works include a 40 foot ceramic mural at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. and pieces for numerous schools, recreational facilities, hospitals, transportation centers, libraries, and elderly housing.

They kick soccer balls, shoot basketballs, collect starfish, cuddle a cat, create chalk drawings on the street, or simply interact with one another. The tree that stretches across the scene hints at the work's simple yet powerful main message: children "branch out" when they play. They learn about their environment, themselves, and others. They grow and develop. In the words of the title, "play is children's work."</about_the_work></row><row _id="116" _uuid="CC5EE443-3799-42F6-8BE3-F19DF079C957" _position="116" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/116"><accession_number>CAC05.03</accession_number><last_name>Jonas </last_name><first_name>Paul, Ramirez</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>"Taylor Square"</title><year>2005</year><location_name_of_site>Taylor Square</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>113 Garden St., Northwest Cambridge, at the intersection of Huron Avenue, Sherman Street, and Garden Street</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Mixed media installation</object_type><material>Painted Metal, Stone</material><size>57 square feet </size><about_the_work>Taylor Square was created by Paul Ramirez Jonas and installed in front of the renovated Engine 8, Ladder 4 fire station in northwest Cambridge, at the intersection of Huron Avenue, Sherman Street, and Garden Street. Taylor Square is the smallest public park in Cambridge, measuring only 57 square feet, and has locked gates. It is a communal space through the distribution of 5,000 artist-designed keys and the invitation to the public to duplicate them endlessly.Further distribution of the keys and, thus, the sustained life of the park is the task of the public. In the artist's words, "Taylor Square belongs to the public. It is closed, yet simultaneously open, re-emphasizing that the ownership of public space resides in the public itself." The keys for Open are a tangible symbol of this relationship between public space and the public.</about_the_work></row><row _id="117" _uuid="05D39878-7528-4EF6-928D-3721CB4E84E7" _position="117" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/117"><accession_number>CAC79.09a</accession_number><last_name>Judelson</last_name><first_name>David</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>Untitled (Pearl St entrance)</title><year>1979</year><location_name_of_site>Library/ Central Square </location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>Check out desk, Pearl Street, and Courtyard entrances </location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Tiles-Ceramic in Floor</object_type><material>Ceramic </material><detail_material>Ceramic</detail_material><size>41"H x 40.5"W</size><about_the_work>Three clusters of ceramic tiles are embedded in the brick paving at the check out desk and at both the Pearl Street and courtyard entrances of the library.

The tiles at the courtyard entrance are impressions made from the library sign above the door. At the Pearl Street entrance, the tiles play on a visual pun. They depict four square objects which can be seen from the library, including a set of pay-phone buttons. On the inside square is the impression of a branch, which makes it the Central Square Branch.

David Judelson originally pursued architecture as an undergraduate and graduate student at M.I.T, but became increasingly interested in ceramics. He studied at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in the 1970s, and has pursued art ever since. His many large-scale public commissions include a sculptural rooftop terrace for Scholastic, Inc., in New York. He also has exhibited his work in numerous group and solo exhibitions.

The tiles at the courtyard entrance are impressions made from the library sign above the door. At the Pearl Street entrance, the tiles play on a visual pun. They depict four square objects which can be seen from the library, including a set of pay-phone buttons. On the inside square is the impression of a branch, which makes it the Central Square Branch.

David Judelson originally pursued architecture as an undergraduate and graduate student at M.I.T, but became increasingly interested in ceramics. He studied at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in the 1970s, and has pursued art ever since. His many large-scale public commissions include a sculptural rooftop terrace for Scholastic, Inc., in New York. He also has exhibited his work in numerous group and solo exhibitions. He spent many years living in the Boston area before moving to New York City.</about_the_work></row><row _id="120" _uuid="109B98EA-04CA-4C98-9C2C-9D5A3AAC0FEB" _position="120" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/120"><accession_number>CAC83.01a</accession_number><last_name>Judelson</last_name><first_name>David</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>"Brickworker and Ballplayer" (brickworker)</title><year>1983</year><location_name_of_site>Rindge Field</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>Rindge Field at Pemberton Street or Intersection of Pemberton and Haskell Streets

Beginning with meetings of the Porter Square Citizen Advisory Committee in 1997, the city worked with the Porter Square Neighborhood Association, residents of Cambridge and Somerville, and the Porter Square businesses to develop a plan for the reconfiguration of Porter Square and its roadway design.

In accordance with the city's Public Art Ordinance, the Cambridge Arts Council commissioned artist Toshihiro Katayama to develop public art for the new plaza as the centerpiece of Porter Square. Katayama worked with landscape architect Cynthia Smith, members of the Porter Square Citizen Advisory Committee, and city staff to develop a bold design for the plaza. The goals of his design were to create a visual identity for the Square, integrate both sides of Massachusetts Avenue, unify the three parts of the plaza visually, and reduce the visual clutter of the busy intersection through simplification and clarity. Natural materials include stonewalls, Cape Ann granite boulders, and new trees and shrubs. Concrete pavers in light and dark grey create a pattern that addresses the entire width of the plaza in one visual sweep. A low steel wall and two free-standing panels continue this pattern with black and white graphics.

Toshihiro Katayama is Professor emeritus at Harvard University, where he taught for 30 years and served as the Director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. His work has been exhibited in more than 30 one-man exhibitions and he has created large-scale sculptures, murals, and environmental work in architectural spaces in the United States and Japan, including major work for the Ohara Art Museum in Kurashiki and the Panasonic Headquarters in Tokyo. In 1974, he collaborated with the poet Octavio Paz on a visual poetry book, Three Notations-Rotations, which was published jointly by Harvard University and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</about_the_work></row><row _id="124" _uuid="DF2EAB3B-EF81-46F0-97AB-166D831357CC" _position="124" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/124"><accession_number>CAC06.01b</accession_number><last_name>Katayama</last_name><first_name>Toshihiro</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>"Porter Square Landscape Design" (landscape panel)</title><year>2006</year><location_name_of_site>Porter Square Plaza</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>At 1931 Mass Ave In front of the Porter Square Shopping Center shopping and directy across from the Porter Square T station</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Metal-Painted Steel</object_type><material>Tnemec painted steel</material><detail_material>Concrete, natural granite boulders, Tnemec painted steel, plantings</detail_material><size>W 258’ x D 94’ overall

Brookline, Boston, and Somerville soon joined in a coalition that defeated the project and ended all new highway construction in Metropolitan Boston.</about_the_work></row><row _id="144" _uuid="140FCA83-CC72-4EF8-A0B5-83BEFB980C12" _position="144" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/144"><accession_number>CAC92.02</accession_number><last_name>Levine</last_name><first_name>Edward</first_name><artist_gender>Male</artist_gender><title>"Floating Stones"</title><year>1992</year><location_name_of_site>Roethlisberger Park</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>off of Walden and Garden Street ?</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Stone and metal </object_type><material>Granite and steel </material><detail_material>Granite blocks (11?)

As a result, the artwork may not be readily noticeable to someone casually strolling through the park, or even to someone sitting on the granite blocks that the artist so carefully placed in the space. But then, that was the intention. Levine wanted to create art that people would experience and use as part of their daily life rather than marvel at from a distance.

Edward Levine is an artist and professor in the Visual Arts Program at M.I.T. Before moving to Cambridge, Levine was dean of the School of Art at East Carolina University. In addition to his public art in Cambridge, he has done permanent work in Pusan, South Korea. Levine also served as chairman of the Visual Arts Policy Panel for the NEA and is the author of several articles an art criticism and theory.</about_the_work></row><row _id="145" _uuid="90E9F16B-6CB0-4F62-9C0B-A5C1D8A46FBE" _position="145" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/145"><accession_number>CAC80.01</accession_number><last_name>Lichtman</last_name><first_name>Linda</first_name><artist_gender>Female </artist_gender><title>Untitled</title><year>1980</year><location_name_of_site>Library/ Central Square Branch Library</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>45 Pearl St., 1st floor reading room </location_description><interior_exterior>Interior</interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture</category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Stained Glass</object_type><material>Glass </material><detail_material>Glass (Leaded, Stained)</detail_material><size>7' x 3'</size><additional_description>Hanging panels, first floor</additional_description><about_the_work>Of her rectangular stained glass window, rendered in earth tones and designed for the main reading room of the library, artist Linda Lichtman says, "I wanted to make a window which would be both colorful and restful -- a window which would be enlivened and animated by the color, yet calmed by the graphic elements.</about_the_work></row><row _id="146" _uuid="D66C8D37-7040-41C3-AC0A-BCE117D9D362" _position="146" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/146"><accession_number>CAC90.02</accession_number><last_name>Lichtman</last_name><first_name>Linda</first_name><artist_gender>Female </artist_gender><title>"Landscape Frieze in Glass"</title><year>1990</year><location_name_of_site>North Cambridge Senior Center</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>2050 Massachusetts Avenue</location_description><interior_exterior>Interior</interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Stained glass</object_type><material>Stained glass</material><detail_material>Etched, stained glass, painted and leaded</detail_material><size>18"x20' front wall</size><additional_description>Landscape Frieze</additional_description><about_the_work>These five panels of etched, stained and leaded glass run along the 20'-long glass window in the lobby of the Cambridge Senior Center. "I work with glass so that it will reflect nature and be alive to light, constantly changing like all things in nature," Lichtman says. "I tear away the surface of the glass with hydrofluoric acid or build up layers of paints, transparent enamels, and silver stain to increase richness and density." From this hazardous process emerges the most delicate of designs. Lichtman explains that each specific piece of glass etches differently. The result is the abstract imagery in "Landscape Frieze in Glass," which illumines the large window in the Cambridge Senior Center, as though the glass itself contained the light.

Lichtman earned her BFA in painting from Massachusetts College of Art in 1974. She studied with a master glass artist Patrick Reyntiens at Burleighfiled House in England and apprenticed to other glass artists in the U.K., Canada and Germany before continuing studies at the Museum School in Boston. Lichtman has lived and worked in Cambridge since 1978.</about_the_work></row><row _id="147" _uuid="61675BF8-4C7C-4491-9D05-F96300971324" _position="147" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/147"><accession_number>CAC87.04.1</accession_number><last_name>Lord</last_name><first_name>Madeleine</first_name><artist_gender>Female</artist_gender><title>"Revolutionary Figures" (female figure)</title><year>1987</year><location_name_of_site>Fort Washington Park</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>Waverly Street and Talbot Street, in park on grass.</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Metal-Painted Steel</object_type><material>Cut and painted steel </material><detail_material>Cut and painted steel</detail_material><size>Figure of a Woman: H 53” x W 4’ x D 3/8”</size><additional_description>Seated female figure, 1 part of 3 components.</additional_description><about_the_work>Five life-size silhouette figures - four minutemen and a Victorian-era woman - stand guard at Fort Washington Park, the only remaining fort built by George Washington, during the siege of Boston in 1775.

After the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the British retreated to Boston. George Washington encircled the city with fortifications, of which this is one. At that time, the fort overlooked the Charles River, and the cannons pointed towards Boston. The area was made into a park in 1857 when the land was donated to the City and the cast-iron fence surrounding the park was erected.
The intent of the cut steel sculptures, says Lord, "was to recreate the Fort's encampment setting and to recall the park's creation and heyday," celebrate both eras in tandem, and pay homage to the park's layered history.

The angular, imposing masks combine elements of African art with Maduna's own expressive style.

Born in Cambridge, Maduna (aka Dennis Didley) spent some time as a teenager at both the Margaret Fuller House and the Cambridge Community Center. He began his exploration of African culture with a study of African religions, and that brought him, quite naturally, to a study of traditional art forms, the embodiment of belief and myth. Art, for Maduna, is spiritually nourishing. "People gather strength through their roots," he says, "and it is through art that we hear our ancestral voices." As an adult, Maduna returned to the neighborhoods of his childhood with reminders of the African heritage that many in the community share. "Totem" literally means the emblem of a clan or family.

Maduna studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and has been an artist-in-residence in the African-American Masters program at Northeastern University. His work has been exhibited in several museums.

A red cross stretches across the composition, symbolizing King's work as a Baptist minister and the blood shed during the Civil Rights Movement. Another metal element suggests the body of a bus, reminding viewers of Rosa Parks' refusal to sit at the back of a public bus in Alabama. Its yellow-orange colors also refer to schoolbuses, which have literally been the vehicles of desegregation for American public schools. Finally, Maduna's main choice of material for the biographical events - black perforated sheet metal - lends the figures a shadowy quality that softens the violence of the scenes yet doesn't diminish the work's powerful message of faith, love, and resistance.

Sculptor/painter Maduna is a lifelong resident of the Boston area. His site-specific work, which combines an interest in African art with his own expressive style, has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. Many of his public installations are located in the Cambridge and Boston area, including The Judge, a recent commission for the Roxbury District Court House. Educated at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, he has been Master Artist in Residence at Northeastern University.

The stone is presented as though it were an offering. Natural elements, such as stone and trees, are often a motif in Phillps' work. "In the woods, looking for sticks and stones for my sculpture," he says, "I am often impressed by the persistence of life. A root can slowly establish a foothold and split a large rock. Lichen and moss extract their nourishment directly from the stone, ultimately processing granite into soil." Of casting bronze tree limbs, Phillips adds, "Metal branches are remarkable in that, although they are perceived as real, they can do things structurally that real twigs can't. For example, they can support a stone, giving the illusion of levitation."

David Phillips received his BFA in Painting and his MFA in Sculpture from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. He has taught at a number of places including Flint Institute of Art, Harvard, and Mass College of Art. His studio and foundry in Somerville are not only busy with his own work, but also much of the bronze casting in the area is done under his careful supervision.

Reimann created the images through sandblasting, in which air or steam carries sand at high velocity to etch the stone. Bold wing patterns worked best with this powerful process, so Reimann chose flamboyant species from around the globe, working from photographs in the collection of Harvard University's Museum of Comparitive Zoology.
A sculptor, draftsman, and designer, Reimann began his career at Yale University, where he received his M.F.A. in 1961. He experimented with Plexiglas and steel earlier in his career, but his current medium of choice is sandblasted stone. Animals and the natural world are frequent subjects, as are designs and symbols from the world's ancient cultures. His works are in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the National Gallery in Washington, DC, as well as in numerous private, corporate, and public settings. A longtime Cambridge resident, Reimann teaches in the Visual and Environmental Studies Department at Harvard University.

The artists have placed a great emphasis on making the area inviting and safe. The dense canopy of Locust trees will be thinned to let sunlight in and special lights will be suspended from cables over the space to provide evenly diffused lighting without lurking shadows. Three 18" high granite planters will be placed in asymmetrical formation, with wood platforms on top for seating. A variety of plants, including a series of white Birches, will reflect the strong tradition of gardening in the neighborhood, while also providing barriers from the loud traffic on both sides of the plaza. A gridded wall along the back will provide a barrier for the direct abutters. The scale of the open spaces between the planters has been determined to encourage groups to assemble for meetings and performances.

In Celebrating the Marshland, her materials include real shells and stones, which, combined with lively images of fish, birds, and turtles, allude to the salt marshes that once covered much of Cambridgeport.

Rosenberg is an accomplished artist whose numerous other Boston-area works include a large mosaic in the MBTA Park Street subway station and another mural for the lobby of the Children's Hospital. Trained in architecture, sculpture, and ceramics, she studied at the Cooper Union and Art Students League (both in New York City), as well as at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. She has lived in New England for most of her working life.

He experimented with plexiglas and steel earlier in his career, but his current medium of choice is sandblasted stone. Animals and the natural world are frequent subjects, as are designs and symbols from the world's ancient cultures. His works are in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the National Gallery in Washington, DC, as well as in numerous private, corporate, and public settings. A longtime Cambridge resident, Reimann teaches in the Visual and Environmental Studies Department at Harvard University.

In the artist's words, his sculptures "celebrate forms that accompany us in the moment, that we all share in nature, culture, sports, and our daily lives." At once playful and mystical, Schelling's abstracted motifs mark the experience of leaving the urban complexity of the neighborhood and entering a park that invites play, rest, and recreation.</about_the_work></row><row _id="248" _uuid="0EBC525C-B72F-4E4C-85BD-A67C54E94543" _position="248" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/248"><accession_number>CAC07.01</accession_number><last_name>Selvage</last_name><first_name>Nancy</first_name><artist_gender>Female </artist_gender><title>"Water Wall"</title><year>2007</year><location_name_of_site>Trolley Square</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>Massachusetts and Cameron Avenues</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Metal </object_type><material>Steel</material><detail_material>Stainless steel (316)</detail_material><size>6' x 33" x 28' </size><additional_description>Perforated steel sculpture</additional_description></row><row _id="229" _uuid="138EF3CD-830D-4C6B-8060-2E5299D93ECE" _position="229" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/229"><accession_number>CAC95.06a</accession_number><last_name>Rosenberg</last_name><first_name>Lilli Ann</first_name><artist_gender>Female </artist_gender><title>Untitled (butterfly)</title><year>1995</year><location_name_of_site>School/ Haggerty</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>110 Cushing Street, interior, front lobby</location_description><interior_exterior>Interior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Mosaic-Mixed Media, Ceramic Tiles </object_type><material>Ceramic tiles, Mixed Media</material><detail_material>Ceramic, mosaic, concrete</detail_material><size>36"H x 29"W x 2.25"D</size><additional_description>1 of 4 mosaics</additional_description><about_the_work>Rosenberg's "collages in concrete" style murals are located so as to be enjoyed by all the students.

After the workshop, the artist took the clay back to her studio and applied to it clear glaze and fired it to protect it for posterity.</about_the_work></row><row _id="237" _uuid="8BD772FA-FDC3-4DAA-9634-FE1E7E7ADAB8" _position="237" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/237"><accession_number>CAC89.04a</accession_number><last_name>Rosenberg</last_name><first_name>Lilli Ann</first_name><artist_gender>Female </artist_gender><title>"Turtles" (front largest turtle)</title><year>1989</year><location_name_of_site>Alden Play Area, Baldwin Park, Oxford Street</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Mosaic-Mixed Media, Concrete </object_type><material>Mixed Media, Concrete, Granite </material><detail_material>Concrete, granite</detail_material><additional_description>3 sculptures on ground</additional_description></row><row _id="238" _uuid="D2AD2110-B3C7-494E-BD21-2B0DA4BBE668" _position="238" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/238"><accession_number>CAC89.04b</accession_number><last_name>Rosenberg</last_name><first_name>Lilli Ann</first_name><artist_gender>Female </artist_gender><title>"Turtles" (middle smallest turtle)</title><year>1989</year><location_name_of_site>Alden Play Area, Baldwin Park, Oxford Street</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Mosaic-Mixed Media, Concrete </object_type><material>Mixed Media, Concrete, Granite </material><detail_material>Concrete, granite</detail_material><additional_description>3 sculptures on ground</additional_description></row><row _id="239" _uuid="624D80B6-7BF0-4178-9F73-07BBF3DDC688" _position="239" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/239"><accession_number>CAC89.04c</accession_number><last_name>Rosenberg</last_name><first_name>Lilli Ann</first_name><artist_gender>Female </artist_gender><title>"Turtles" (back turtle)</title><year>1989</year><location_name_of_site>Alden Play Area, Baldwin Park, Oxford Street</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Mosaic-Mixed Media, Concrete </object_type><material>Mixed Media, Concrete, Granite </material><detail_material>Concrete, granite</detail_material><additional_description>3 sculptures on ground</additional_description></row><row _id="240" _uuid="D7E55FB2-FD99-4721-8320-82611918B01D" _position="240" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/240"><accession_number>CAC88.03</accession_number><last_name>Ryerson</last_name><first_name>Mitch</first_name><artist_gender>Male</artist_gender><title>"Front Desk"</title><year>1988</year><location_name_of_site>Library/ Boudreau Branch</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>Located at 245 Concord Ave, serving as the library's card catalog and main circulation desk</location_description><interior_exterior>Interior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Wood-Painted</object_type><material>Birch, cherry and maple wood </material><detail_material>Birch, cherry, maple wood</detail_material><size>10'x10'</size><additional_description>Relief</additional_description><about_the_work>The sculptural desk made of birch, cherry, and maple wood and painted in vibrant colors, serves as the library's card catalog and main circulation desk. The front of the desk is decorated with a carved panel that depicts neighborhood buildings, including St. Peter's Church and the Harvard Observatory. A prime example of art-furniture, the desk helps shape the character of the library, while serving both decorative and functional purposes.

Ryerson says that furniture appeals to him because the viewer can interact with it. His work invites a connection that is often hard to obtain with other fine arts, such as sculpture. He feels the intimacy and casualness of his work make it less intimidating to people. "I want people to be able to approach my work," he says. "My artwork isn't about heavy existential crises - it's about feeling good, about experiencing pleasure."

Ryerson has operated Ryerson Studios located in Cambridge for many years, making custom furniture sold through galleries and on a commission basis. Originally a boat builder in Maine, he shifted into furniture because, as he says, it gave him a "freedom of expression." In 1998 he received the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts artist award. The society is the oldest nonprofit craft organization in America and awarded Ryerson the prize for "showing mastery in his medium by creating original and creative contemporary crafts."

There was a tremendous outpouring of money, condolences and support from the local community and friends of the family in the months following his passing. At the base of the granite pedestal which "DooDoo" (Igor's favorite puppet) sits on, are three bronze bricks with a memorial inscription. The plaque not only memorializes Igor, but pays tribute to all street performers. The location of the memorial is on the corner of One Brattle Square, where Igor worked most often and performed his final show. It was designed so as to not interfere or make it difficult for other performers to use the spot for future shows.

A graduate of the St. Petersburg Theatrical Institute in Russia, Fokin moved to Cambridge, MA in the summer of 1993 and was instantly surrounded by mesmerized admirers. Children and adults were captivated by the intricate, gentle and life-like character of his creations. By the end of the summer, he had established himself as one of the most popular acts in the Boston area. In the summer of 1996, he performed at the Olympic festivities in Atlanta.

Konstantin Simun was born in Leningrad, USSR in 1934 and has lived with his family in the Boston area since 1988. He has a degree in sculpture from the Repin Art Institute in Leningrad and has completed several large and small public art commisions. His work is part of the permanent collections of many of the largest museums in Russia.</about_the_work></row><row _id="255" _uuid="94AEC9B7-3675-454E-9B1B-4A033186E033" _position="255" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/255"><accession_number>CAC04.03</accession_number><last_name>Slosberg-Ackerman</last_name><first_name>Jill</first_name><artist_gender>Female</artist_gender><title>"Rei"</title><year>2004</year><location_name_of_site>Squirrel Brand Park</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>Broadway between Columbia and Windsor</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Metal </object_type><material>Steel </material><detail_material>Steel (painted)</detail_material><size>Squirrel: H 5’10” x W 5’6” x D 4’</size></row><row _id="256" _uuid="A5B93E57-2987-4B52-A088-68830A6FA1FE" _position="256" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/256"><accession_number>CAC07.04</accession_number><last_name>Speiser</last_name><first_name>Ken</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>"Hearth"</title><year>2007</year><location_name_of_site>Greene-Rose Heritage Park</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Scuplture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Brick, and steel </object_type><material>Brick and steel </material><detail_material>Brick, steel</detail_material><size>59"H x 108"W x 44"D</size><additional_description>Brick hearth</additional_description></row><row _id="257" _uuid="D0272530-6635-4889-9856-36A67B32E817" _position="257" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/257"><accession_number>CAC02.03a</accession_number><last_name>Tagiuri</last_name><first_name>John</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>"Chairs and Endless Lamps" (proper left lamp)</title><year>2002</year><location_name_of_site>Area 4 Youth Center </location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>Located behind 243 Harvard street Between the youth center building and the adjacent Sennot Park Basketball court</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Concrete, Metal</object_type><material>Concrete </material><detail_material>Concrete</detail_material><about_the_work>With a characteristic whimsy, artist John Tagiuri is creating cast concrete lazy chairs, a grand stairway, and two endless-column living room lamps by the youth center's back patio.

Taho spent five months soliciting "dream statements" via public meetings, workshops, and "dream collection boxes" around the Square. She then inscribed selections on six rings of brass cylinders. The statements range from personal ambitions (becoming a teacher, veterinarian, or dancer; finishing college) to goals for the world at large (ending racism and pollution, increasing tolerance and unity). Three of the scroll rings rest on a pillar of frosted glass bearing the word "dream" in 48 languages. These three "dream towers" (one shown here) are internally lit, providing a comforting glow for nighttime passersby.  Taho received a BFA and MFA in design from Musashino Art University in Tokyo and an MFA in sculpture from Yale University. She has exhibited her work in group and solo exhibitions at museums and galleries around the world and received numerous commissions for temporary and permanent public installations in the U.S. and Japan.

Consisting of an aerial view of Cambridge and its enivirons, from the Mystic River to Walden Pond, the map shows the entire reservoir system and associated watershed. Using topographical maps and high altitude infrared photographs from NASA as source material, she added, in painstaking detail, all of the streets and buildings in Cambridge, as well as the streams and lakes which form the city's water system. The mural's dominant colors are green, blue, and tan, with two stark lines, one red and one blue, which represent the water supply conduits. The areas within the borders of the watershed are painted in higher contrast and with more saturated color than the surrounding areas, which are more loosely painted in softer colors.

Turre studied at Sonoma State University and at the University of Iowa. She has exhibited widely in Massachusetts, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin, New York, and Connecticut.

Fifty faces of area residents -- randomly assembled from photographs taken in the neighborhood by the artist -- comprise this 'tower' of faces. Even the artist does not know who the persons depicted are, and some of them may be unaware that their image is preserved in bronze, but each of the fifty faces speaks of individuality and personal conviction, however harmoniously intermixed it may be in the sculptural whole.

Tyler has studied at Hampshire and Nasson colleges. He specializes in life-size sculpture and has completed many public art commissions, including a series of realistic figures for Davis Square in Somerville as part of the MBTA Arts On The Line Program.</about_the_work></row><row _id="275" _uuid="413C0969-8574-48CD-86E8-19F80BBDF9D1" _position="275" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/275"><accession_number>CAC99.10a</accession_number><last_name>Ukeles</last_name><first_name>Mierle</first_name><artist_gender>Female</artist_gender><title>“Turnaround/Surround” (Art Blocks)</title><year>2001</year><location_name_of_site>Danehy Park</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>By the eastern parking lot</location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Concrete </object_type><material>Concrete </material><detail_material>Concrete </detail_material><size>27’ x 18” x 18”</size><additional_description>Cast stone, stained black</additional_description><about_the_work>"Turnaround Surround" is a public artwork incorporated into the landscape of a 55-acre former dumpsite and landfill closed in 1972. The art includes a half-mile long glassphalt path that traverses the central mound in the park, providing access to the top and views of the Boston skyline. With 22 tons of crushed glass and mirror mixed into the asphalt, the use of glassphalt (for the first time in Massachusetts) suggests that there exist creative, sound solutions to environmental problems. The artist and the landscape architect also collaborated on a planting plan for the mound. The final phase of the art project will include sculptural disks made of rubber and will involve members of all the different cultures of the City in a creative interaction.

William Wainwright deserves to be called a 20th century "renaissance artist," applying his professional training in both architecture and engineering to create complex and innovative mobile sculptures. Besides his creative contribution to art, he holds two U.S. patents. Wainwright studied at Purdue University, Cornell, the Institute of Design in Chicago, and M.I.T. He taught architecture at Harvard Graduate School of Design for a number of years and his sculptures have been exhibited in numerous technological and art venues alike</about_the_work></row><row _id="282" _uuid="48017314-FEA2-4C9F-9B38-EF4ECC8EC90C" _position="282" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/282"><accession_number>CAC92.03.1</accession_number><last_name>Webb</last_name><first_name>Nancy</first_name><artist_gender>Female</artist_gender><title>Untitled (Insects) (small medallion with flower imagery)</title><year>1992</year><location_name_of_site>Charles Park at Cambridgeside Place and Land Blvd</location_name_of_site><location_1 needs_recoding="false"/><location_description>Commercial Avenue at the intersection of Charles Street; scattered around the park </location_description><interior_exterior>Exterior </interior_exterior><category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic>Sculpture </category_sculpture_work_on_paper_paintings_mural_electronic_media_temporary_programmatic><object_type>Bronze </object_type><material>Bronze </material><detail_material>Bronze</detail_material><size>4"Dia</size><additional_description>Located inside park, near Cambridgeside Place entrance, on top of granite curb.

A bronze plaque, also made by the artist, lists all the bronze plants and creatures found in the park.

For this project, Whitman translates one of her paintings into a 36”x 48” glass tile mosaic entitled, Brain Terrain. The design juxtaposes symbols of the U.S.A., Haiti, China, India, &amp; Portugal, countries representing Cambridge’s most recent immigrant populations, with references to the Charles River and surrounding location. Whitman’s concept is to create “icons of language” that generate pride and connection to Cambridge. The construction of the plaza, which began in Spring 2007 and was dedicated on June 25, 2008, includes trees, seating, pedestrian lighting, and space for community events, and is part of a larger infrastructure design project.</about_the_work></row><row _id="325" _uuid="DB10A121-1685-47F9-971D-01E00B74FC77" _position="325" _address="http://data.cambridgema.gov/resource/svyv-zh72/325"><accession_number>CAC09.02</accession_number><last_name>Wodiczko</last_name><first_name>Krzysztof</first_name><artist_gender>Male </artist_gender><title>Illumination Project for the Robert W.
