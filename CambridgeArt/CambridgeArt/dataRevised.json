   "About The Work": "Drawn Water combines real drinking water, symbolic elements, and a 2500 sq. foot map that focuses attention on the importance of water in our lives. The underground pipes that bring the water throughout the city are marked on the map, along with water fountains, swimming pools, and ponds. Actual water pipes form functional seats and suggest the sizes of pipes in the map. A transparent water column is placed on the map at the site of the city's holding reservoir, Payson Park. The art continues outside the building. A shallow depression on both sides of a path reveals a 42 inch pipe, reminding us of the connection between the treatment facility and Fresh Pond, the city's reservoir. A circular opening in the fence around the pond focuses views of the water intake. A drinking fountain in the form of a squirting arc offers water to users of the path. When they drink from the fountain, the water column reacts with light, bubbles and changes in the water level, as if the water had been drawn through the large pipe back from the treatment facility. There are also thirteen bronze utility covers located throughout the city, each with a different water-related image. The locations of the covers are marked on the floor map to encourage a treasure hunt in the neighborhoods.\n\nMags Harries and Lajos H_der have collaborated on several projects since 1990, ranging from large-scale commissions to temporary installations and performances."

Andrews has proposed to create aluminum security screens for the window openings, with colored glass and optical lenses inserted into the screen. The glass will cast colored shadows and the lenses will reflect images of passers-by on the interior walls. The proposal works on two levels: On a practical level, the grid structure makes the large window openings safe and protects the stairway from wind and rain, without enclosing it with solid glass. And on an aesthetic level, this practical solution provides visual interest and improves the look of the building where it is most visible."

Wood sculptures mix geometrical forms (the five Platonic solids) with shapes found in the natural world. Evoking everything from galaxies and tornadoes to atoms and crystals, this piece inspires reverence and awe for both the variety and surprising similarities of forms found on Earth and in the cosmos.\nBeatty is a graduate of the University of Kansas and the Massachusetts College of Art. His work has appeared in exhibitions throughout the Boston area and is in the collections of several museums and corporations, including the DeCordova Museum in Lincoln, Massachusetts. He participated in the DeCordova's popular 1995 \"Strokes of Genius\" installation, in which 18 artists each created a unique hole for a functioning mini golf course. He currently resides in Newton, Massachusetts, and teaches sculpture at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts."

   "About The Work": "The inspiration for Alston Conley's four-part mural is the \"map room\" found in many Renaissance-era Italian government buildings. In Conley's words, maps historically represented \"influence, trade, knowledge, and power.\" This mural certainly encourages knowledge - it's located on the west wall of the school library and can be used as a teaching tool. It also celebrates the international character of the school. At the time of Conley's commission, Longfellow School's student body represented 43 different countries. Made with the Renaissance-era technique of fresco painting, this map, says Conley, \"is intended to remind us of the changing world we all belong to.\"\nConley first encountered map rooms in the early 1980s, when he traveled to Italy on a Fulbright scholarship. Although he is one of the few artists still practicing the art of fresco painting, he now concentrates on the \"more portable\" medium of oil painting. Conley has exhibited in solo and group shows around the country and his work is in several museums and corporate collections. Educated at the Pratt Institute, the Boston Museum School, and Tufts University, he serves as an adjunct professor in Fine Arts at Boston College and is curator for Boston College's McMullen Museum of Art."

   "About The Work": "At the entrance to the park, Davis's design of the bus shelter brings her artistic vision to a utilitarian structure in a busy urban site. Her choice of materials and sculptural forms reference the past and present uses of the Park. The shelter sits on the edge of a small body of water (\"Jerry's Pit\") that once was a clay pit for the local nineteenth-century brickmaking industry. Later it became a swimming hole and eventually an industrial site and environmental blemish.\n\nDavis's rose-tinted glass panels forming the walls of the bus shelter make a reference to our desire to see beauty where there is blight. Rose-colored panes are punctuated by clear panels, and as one moves in and out of the structure, our view of our surroundings, through carefully callibrated spaces, makes subtle shifts. The wood bench extends beyond the perimeter of the shelter, evoking the length of a baseball dugout and the activity of waiting, shared by baseball player and bus rider alike. The shelter has extra height and encourages an upward glance, where the rose of the glass, the blue of the sky, and the tips of the nearby trees share one's frame of vision.\n\n"

Sited in an open area in the Alewife reservation, the portals accentuate the new entrance to the bikeway's extension and provide a point of departure for trips along the trail. Showcasing the qualities that have made Dorrien's work outstanding in the field of stone sculpture, the monoliths display finely carved images of alewives in stark juxtaposition to roughhewn stone, carefully selected by the artist for its texture and shading. Painstakingly chiselled into the stone, the images demonstrate the artist's uncommon mastery of the time-honored method of stone carving.\nDorrien was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

He believes that the passion an artist has for his material is translated in his work. \"Even with a public piece one wants to make beautiful objects, to provoke questions, to make a personal statement; but finally public art is a gift to others, and if you love your medium, that magic comes through.\"\n\nDorrien was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The result is a three times life-size portrait of all members of Engine Company No. 5 in firefighting gear, along with the company dalmatian, posed around one of their pump trucks. Also included in the scene are two volunteer firemen straight out of history. Benjamin Franklin, who founded the first volunteer fire department in the country, stands on the running board in a pair of red sneakers. George Washington, who resided in Cambridge during the Siege of Boston, is holding a couple of pails.

Fichter shows Parks telling her story to a group of school-children, whose diverse ethnicities not only reflect Cambridge's multi-cultural makeup but also embody the spirit of the Civil Rights Movement.

Beginning with meetings of the Porter Square Citizen Advisory Committee in 1997, the city worked with the Porter Square Neighborhood Association, residents of Cambridge and Somerville, and the Porter Square businesses to develop a plan for the reconfiguration of Porter Square and its roadway design.\n\nIn accordance with the city's Public Art Ordinance, the Cambridge Arts Council commissioned artist Toshihiro Katayama to develop public art for the new plaza as the centerpiece of Porter Square. Katayama worked with landscape architect Cynthia Smith, members of the Porter Square Citizen Advisory Committee, and city staff to develop a bold design for the plaza. The goals of his design were to create a visual identity for the Square, integrate both sides of Massachusetts Avenue, unify the three parts of the plaza visually, and reduce the visual clutter of the busy intersection through simplification and clarity. Natural materials include stonewalls, Cape Ann granite boulders, and new trees and shrubs. Concrete pavers in light and dark grey create a pattern that addresses the entire width of the plaza in one visual sweep. A low steel wall and two free-standing panels continue this pattern with black and white graphics.\n\nToshihiro Katayama is Professor emeritus at Harvard University, where he taught for 30 years and served as the Director of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts. His work has been exhibited in more than 30 one-man exhibitions and he has created large-scale sculptures, murals, and environmental work in architectural spaces in the United States and Japan, including major work for the Ohara Art Museum in Kurashiki and the Panasonic Headquarters in Tokyo. In 1974, he collaborated with the poet Octavio Paz on a visual poetry book, Three Notations-Rotations, which was published jointly by Harvard University and the Museum of Modern Art in New York."

   "About The Work": "A small traffic-calming project near the Fitzgerald School in North Cambridge provided the occasion for this unusual work of art. Narrowing a wide intersection resulted in the creation of a small plaza with trees, which in turn became the canvas for well-known local painter, Jane Goldman.\n\nGoldman's goal for her piece in newly constructed Sheridan Square was to create a serene \"New England oasis in an urban environment.\" Using the unexpected but durable and affordable medium of yellow, black, red, and white construction pavers, she designed patterns around the square's five tree pits. The arrangements are derived from traditional quilt patterns, summoning up associations of comfort and warmth, as well as paying tribute to one of America's most enduring homespun artforms.\n\nEducated at Smith College and the University of Wisconsin, where she received her M.F.A., Goldman is a prolific and versatile artist. Her works, executed in watercolor, oil, intaglio, lithography, relief, screenprint, and terrazzo, have been exhibited widely in the U.S. and Europe, and are part of the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum, Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Cleveland Museum, and Library of Congress, among others. Local travelers may be familiar with Goldman's aquatic-themed terrazzo walkways at Logan International Airport. She is a resident of Somerville, MA.\n\n"

   "About The Work": "George Greenamyer's monumental sculptures for public spaces are carefully engineered interpretations of regional history. His East Cambridge-1852 is a narrative work celebrating the furniture-making and glass-blowing industries which flourished in East Cambridge during the 19th century. Located on 10 and 12-foot columns at the pedestrian entrance to the garage, the sculpture is constructed of mild steel that is forged and painted in high-gloss epoxy colors. From left to right, the work depicts: a brickworker's home with smoke from the hearthfire blowing out of the chimney; a glass-blower and his helper; the two main kiln buildings of the Boston Porcelain and Glassworks, with a worker in-between and black smoke wafting from the elevated industrial chimneys; the proud president of the company with a finished product in his hands; three workers' row houses; two chairs; three furniture makers; and Geldowsky's Furniture Company. A well-dressed Cambridge couple from that era and another worker's house complete the piece.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Ohio, George received his BFA in Dimensional Design from the Philadelphia Museum College and an MFA in sculpture from the University of Kansas. He taught as a Professor at the Massachusetts College of Art and worked as chair of the sculpture department for many years. He has been awarded commissions in nearly all states through \"one percent\" programs.\n\n"

The desk, built to triple scale, supports an equally oversized cup, bowl, and pile of books - all seemingly left behind by a giant schoolchild. Adding to the mystery are an open drawer and the pink glow from a hidden electric light. In designing this fairy-tale sculpture, Harries chose to work in wood, as opposed to cheaper materials like plastic, and had the piece crafted by a cabinetmaker using traditional techniques. Harries then covered the desk in six coats of different colored paint - providing an element of surprised delight when students scratch their initials into the \"magic desk.\"\nHarries's public art projects range from indoor installations like Gateway to large-scale outdoor structures that grace museums, parks, and institutions around the U.S. and Great Britain. Many of these works can be found in the Boston/Cambridge area, the most familiar being the Asaroton '76 cross walk at Haymarket and Glove Cycle at the Porter Square MBTA subway station. Harries has taught at the Boston's School of the Museum of Fine Arts and frequently gives lectures and workshops on public art around the country."

   "About The Work": "Drawn Water combines real drinking water, symbolic elements, and a 2500 sq. foot map that focuses attention on the importance of water in our lives. The underground pipes that bring the water throughout the city are marked on the map, along with water fountains, swimming pools, and ponds. Actual water pipes form functional seats and suggest the sizes of pipes in the map. A transparent water column is placed on the map at the site of the city's holding reservoir, Payson Park. The art continues outside the building. A shallow depression on both sides of a path reveals a 42 inch pipe, reminding us of the connection between the treatment facility and Fresh Pond, the city's reservoir. A circular opening in the fence around the pond focuses views of the water intake. A drinking fountain in the form of a squirting arc offers water to users of the path. When they drink from the fountain, the water column reacts with light, bubbles and changes in the water level, as if the water had been drawn through the large pipe back from the treatment facility. There are also thirteen bronze utility covers located throughout the city, each with a different water-related image. The locations of the covers are marked on the floor map to encourage a treasure hunt in the neighborhoods.\n\nMags Harries and Lajos H_der have collaborated on several projects since 1990, ranging from large-scale commissions to temporary installations and performances."

   "About The Work": "The Gately Shelter provides a range of offerings for the entire North Cambridge community, but primarily serves children and teens ages eight to eighteen. When Hsu received this commission, she reflected that \"kids like to hang out in hallways, stairwells, corners - places without a designated function.\" In response, she designed two seating alcoves where young people can \"come and go; be part of traffic; observe and be observed.\" She wanted the design to be bright, welcoming, and clearly for kids. She chose the structure's maple wood for its warm golden tones. The glass tiles reflect and \"move\" light, while the etched \"squiggle\" designs on their surface suggest \"narrative, pathways, and the human body.\" The rainbow spectrum is actually acrylic paint on MDO board behind the glass. Hsu dabbed on many layers of contrasting hues to achieve the rich, saturated colors.\n\nAn installation artist and sculptor, Hsu-Flanders studied at Wellesley College, Harvard University, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. She has exhibited extensively around the U.S. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University as well as in private collections. She is a resident of Cambridge, MA.\n\n"

   "About The Work": "As its title reveals, Judith Inglese's ceramic tile mural takes the Civil Rights-era folk song \"If I Had a Hammer\" as its inspiration. Just as the song celebrates \"the love between my sisters and my brothers, all over this land\" the artwork presents scenes of cross-cultural understanding. Children and adults from different backgrounds fly kites, make music, shoot basketball, admire butterflies and birds, climb and play on the structure, and share stories. Inglese's signature style borrows from the tradition of stained glass: irregular clay shapes form images, which, in turn, are outlined by grout, much like the way lead surrounds stained glass.\nA Massachusetts resident, Inglese studied at Sarah Lawrence College, at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome, and at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. She has received several grants for community based art workshops in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. Her other public works include a 40 foot ceramic mural at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. and pieces for numerous schools, recreational facilities, hospitals, transportation centers, libraries, and elderly housing.\n\n"

The tree that stretches across the scene hints at the work's simple yet powerful main message: children \"branch out\" when they play. They learn about their environment, themselves, and others.

Taylor Square is the smallest public park in Cambridge, measuring only 57 square feet, and has locked gates. It is a communal space through the distribution of 5,000 artist-designed keys and the invitation to the public to duplicate them endlessly.Further distribution of the keys and, thus, the sustained life of the park is the task of the public. In the artist's words, \"Taylor Square belongs to the public. It is closed, yet simultaneously open, re-emphasizing that the ownership of public space resides in the public itself.\" The keys for Open are a tangible symbol of this relationship between public space and the public."

   "About The Work": "Three clusters of ceramic tiles are embedded in the brick paving at the check out desk and at both the Pearl Street and courtyard entrances of the library. On an August day in 1979, David Judelson recorded the library transactions by embossing the tiles in front of the check out desk with impressions of books, library cards, date stamps, names of kids and librarians, footprints and a projector reel.\n\nThe tiles at the courtyard entrance are impressions made from the library sign above the door. At the Pearl Street entrance, the tiles play on a visual pun. They depict four square objects which can be seen from the library, including a set of pay-phone buttons. On the inside square is the impression of a branch, which makes it the Central Square Branch.\n\nDavid Judelson originally pursued architecture as an undergraduate and graduate student at M.I.T, but became increasingly interested in ceramics. He studied at the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in the 1970s, and has pursued art ever since. His many large-scale public commissions include a sculptural rooftop terrace for Scholastic, Inc., in New York. He also has exhibited his work in numerous group and solo exhibitions. He spent many years living in the Boston area before moving to New York City."

   "About The Work": "When the Morse School was built, architect Carl Koch commissioned well known Cambridge artists Juliet and Gyorgy Kepes to design bold art panels for the hallways of the school. The Kepeses experimented with color and design, scooping granular pigments from big buckets onto metal sheets, making patterns by pressing leaves into the colors, then shoving the test pieces into enormous ovens heated to 2000 degrees. After long hours of experimentation, the artists created the five bird and tree designs, which are on view in the primary wing of the school.\n\nBorn in Hungary, Gyorgy began his career as a painter but turned to photography and filmmaking. He is perhaps best known as the founder of MIT's Center for Advanced Visual Studies. Juliet was born in England and worked as a painter, sculptor, and graphic artist, and is highly acclaimed for her beautifully illustrated children's books"

   "About The Work": "The mural celebrates the triumph of people over machines by depicting the successful effort of neighborhood residents to block construction of the Inner Belt Highway (extension of I-95) through Cambridge in 1971. The city of Cambridge was the first to organize against the eight-lane highway project, which would have displaced the Brookline/Elm Street neighborhoods and split the city of Cambridge in half. Brookline, Boston, and Somerville soon joined in a coalition that defeated the project and ended all new highway construction in Metropolitan Boston."

   "About The Work": "Wanting to integrate his work into the new park, Levine worked extensively with the landscape architect, John Kissida, who provided him with expert advice on plantings, pavers, and the grading of the area. As a result, the artwork may not be readily noticeable to someone casually strolling through the park, or even to someone sitting on the granite blocks that the artist so carefully placed in the space. But then, that was the intention. Levine wanted to create art that people would experience and use as part of their daily life rather than marvel at from a distance.\n\nEdward Levine is an artist and professor in the Visual Arts Program at M.I.T. Before moving to Cambridge, Levine was dean of the School of Art at East Carolina University. In addition to his public art in Cambridge, he has done permanent work in Pusan, South Korea. Levine also served as chairman of the Visual Arts Policy Panel for the NEA and is the author of several articles an art criticism and theory."

Lichtman explains that each specific piece of glass etches differently. The result is the abstract imagery in \"Landscape Frieze in Glass,\" which illumines the large window in the Cambridge Senior Center, as though the glass itself contained the light.\n\nLichtman earned her BFA in painting from Massachusetts College of Art in 1974. She studied with a master glass artist Patrick Reyntiens at Burleighfiled House in England and apprenticed to other glass artists in the U.K., Canada and Germany before continuing studies at the Museum School in Boston. Lichtman has lived and worked in Cambridge since 1978."

A red cross stretches across the composition, symbolizing King's work as a Baptist minister and the blood shed during the Civil Rights Movement. Another metal element suggests the body of a bus, reminding viewers of Rosa Parks' refusal to sit at the back of a public bus in Alabama. Its yellow-orange colors also refer to schoolbuses, which have literally been the vehicles of desegregation for American public schools. Finally, Maduna's main choice of material for the biographical events - black perforated sheet metal - lends the figures a shadowy quality that softens the violence of the scenes yet doesn't diminish the work's powerful message of faith, love, and resistance.\n\nSculptor/painter Maduna is a lifelong resident of the Boston area. His site-specific work, which combines an interest in African art with his own expressive style, has been exhibited in galleries and museums around the world. Many of his public installations are located in the Cambridge and Boston area, including The Judge, a recent commission for the Roxbury District Court House.

   "About The Work": "David Phillip's sculpture consists of a large granite stone \"levitated\" by bronze tree limbs. The stone is presented as though it were an offering. Natural elements, such as stone and trees, are often a motif in Phillps' work. \"In the woods, looking for sticks and stones for my sculpture,\" he says, \"I am often impressed by the persistence of life. A root can slowly establish a foothold and split a large rock. Lichen and moss extract their nourishment directly from the stone, ultimately processing granite into soil.\" Of casting bronze tree limbs, Phillips adds, \"Metal branches are remarkable in that, although they are perceived as real, they can do things structurally that real twigs can't. For example, they can support a stone, giving the illusion of levitation.\"\n\nDavid Phillips received his BFA in Painting and his MFA in Sculpture from the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Michigan. He has taught at a number of places including Flint Institute of Art, Harvard, and Mass College of Art. His studio and foundry in Somerville are not only busy with his own work, but also much of the bronze casting in the area is done under his careful supervision.\n\n"

These references to the natural world are combined with symbols of the microcosm and macrocosm of the universe -- images from astronomy, subatomic particles, music and ancient cultures.\n\n\"Use of water, the historical connection with the ocean, and proximity to the Science Museum interested me,\" says Phillips. \"One bronze medallion incorporates music notation from Debussey's La Mer. Like the changing patterns in the sand, music, too, is transient.\"\nDavid Phillips is well known for his public sculpture and his collaborations with landscape architects.

The dense canopy of Locust trees will be thinned to let sunlight in and special lights will be suspended from cables over the space to provide evenly diffused lighting without lurking shadows. Three 18\" high granite planters will be placed in asymmetrical formation, with wood platforms on top for seating. A variety of plants, including a series of white Birches, will reflect the strong tradition of gardening in the neighborhood, while also providing barriers from the loud traffic on both sides of the plaza. A gridded wall along the back will provide a barrier for the direct abutters. The scale of the open spaces between the planters has been determined to encourage groups to assemble for meetings and performances.\n\n"

One is by the front entrance and the other is in the entryway to the lower level of the building, where it can be seen by the students on their way to lunch or the gymnasium as well as by the general public using the community room. Embedded in the cement are individual clay pieces and found objects such as mosaics, stones, shells, leafs, keys, and other fascinating, simple and ordinary objects from all over the world. As many of the students as possible were engaged in the creation of the art. At a workshop the students drew on and cut rolled-out clay to make silhouettes of themselves and other images for the murals. After the workshop, the artist took the clay back to her studio and applied to it clear glaze and fired it to protect it for posterity."

The front of the desk is decorated with a carved panel that depicts neighborhood buildings, including St. Peter's Church and the Harvard Observatory. A prime example of art-furniture, the desk helps shape the character of the library, while serving both decorative and functional purposes.\n\nRyerson says that furniture appeals to him because the viewer can interact with it. His work invites a connection that is often hard to obtain with other fine arts, such as sculpture. He feels the intimacy and casualness of his work make it less intimidating to people. \"I want people to be able to approach my work,\" he says. \"My artwork isn't about heavy existential crises - it's about feeling good, about experiencing pleasure.\"\n\nRyerson has operated Ryerson Studios located in Cambridge for many years, making custom furniture sold through galleries and on a commission basis. Originally a boat builder in Maine, he shifted into furniture because, as he says, it gave him a \"freedom of expression.\" In 1998 he received the Boston Society of Arts and Crafts artist award. The society is the oldest nonprofit craft organization in America and awarded Ryerson the prize for \"showing mastery in his medium by creating original and creative contemporary crafts.\"\n\n"

At the base of the granite pedestal which \"DooDoo\" (Igor's favorite puppet) sits on, are three bronze bricks with a memorial inscription. The plaque not only memorializes Igor, but pays tribute to all street performers. The location of the memorial is on the corner of One Brattle Square, where Igor worked most often and performed his final show. It was designed so as to not interfere or make it difficult for other performers to use the spot for future shows.\n\nA graduate of the St. Petersburg Theatrical Institute in Russia, Fokin moved to Cambridge, MA in the summer of 1993 and was instantly surrounded by mesmerized admirers. Children and adults were captivated by the intricate, gentle and life-like character of his creations. By the end of the summer, he had established himself as one of the most popular acts in the Boston area. In the summer of 1996, he performed at the Olympic festivities in Atlanta.\n\nKonstantin Simun was born in Leningrad, USSR in 1934 and has lived with his family in the Boston area since 1988. He has a degree in sculpture from the Repin Art Institute in Leningrad and has completed several large and small public art commisions.

Three of the scroll rings rest on a pillar of frosted glass bearing the word \"dream\" in 48 languages. These three \"dream towers\" (one shown here) are internally lit, providing a comforting glow for nighttime passersby.  Taho received a BFA and MFA in design from Musashino Art University in Tokyo and an MFA in sculpture from Yale University.

Consisting of an aerial view of Cambridge and its enivirons, from the Mystic River to Walden Pond, the map shows the entire reservoir system and associated watershed. Using topographical maps and high altitude infrared photographs from NASA as source material, she added, in painstaking detail, all of the streets and buildings in Cambridge, as well as the streams and lakes which form the city's water system. The mural's dominant colors are green, blue, and tan, with two stark lines, one red and one blue, which represent the water supply conduits. The areas within the borders of the watershed are painted in higher contrast and with more saturated color than the surrounding areas, which are more loosely painted in softer colors.\n\nTurre studied at Sonoma State University and at the University of Iowa. She has exhibited widely in Massachusetts, Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin, New York, and Connecticut.\n\n"
